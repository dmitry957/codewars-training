## Description

Write the following function:

```python
def area_of_inscribed_polygon(circle_radius, number_of_sides):
```

It should calculate the area of a regular polygon of `numberOfSides`, `number-of-sides`, or `number_of_sides` sides inside a circle of radius `circleRadius`, `circle-radius`, or `circle_radius` which passes through all the vertices of the polygon (such circle is called circumscribed circle or circumcircle).

## Input :: Output Examples

```python
area_of_inscribed_polygon(3, 3) # returns 11.691342951089922

area_of_inscribed_polygon(5.8, 7) # returns 92.05283874578583

area_of_inscribed_polygon(4, 5) # returns 38.04226065180614
```
