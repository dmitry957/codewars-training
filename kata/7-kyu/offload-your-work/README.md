# Offload your work!

You are the best freelancer in the city. Everybody knows you, but what they don't know is that you are actually offloading your work to other freelancers and rarely need to do any work. You're living the life!

To make this process easier, you need to write a method called `workNeeded` to figure out how much time you need to contribute to a project.

Given:
- The amount of time in minutes needed to complete the project
- An array of pair values representing other freelancers' time in `[Hours, Minutes]` format (e.g., `[[2, 33], [3, 44]]`)

Calculate how much time you will need to contribute to the project (if at all) and return a string depending on the case:

- If you need to contribute time to the project, return:
  - `"I need to work x hour(s) and y minute(s)"`
- If you don't have to contribute any time to the project, return:
  - `"Easy Money!"`
