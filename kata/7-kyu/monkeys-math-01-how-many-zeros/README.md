[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56c2acc8c44a3ad6e400050a/python)

## Description
Gigi is a clever monkey, living in the zoo, his teacher (animal keeper) recently taught him some knowledge of "0".

In Gigi's eyes, "0" is a character contains some circle (maybe one, maybe two).

So, a is a "0", b is a "0", 6 is also a "0", and 8 have two "0", etc...

Now, write some code to count how many "0"s in the text.

Let us see who is smarter? You? or monkey?

Input always be a string (including words numbers and symbols). You don't need to verify it, but pay attention to the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.

Here is a table of characters:

| Number of zeros | Characters                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1              | abdegopq069DOPQR     () <-- A pair of braces as a zero |
| 2              | %&B8                                       |

Output will be a number of "0".
