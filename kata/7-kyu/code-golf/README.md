# Code Golf - 7 kyu

## Kata Description

Given a character, return True if your source code (the one from solution tab) contains this character or False if it doesn't.

## Example

```python
d('d')  # probably True, because the name of the function is 'd', unless you obfuscate it
```

Importing is disabled. You also may not use open('solution.py') to fetch your code from the file system, that's cheating.

Keep your code short (under 33 characters)
