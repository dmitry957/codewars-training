## Task
The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. In this kata, you have to find out the number of `'1'` bits in the binary representation of a number.

## Details
- Implement a function that returns the number of `'1'` bits in the binary representation of a given number.
- **Do not use string operations** to solve this task.

## Examples
```python
hamming_weight(10) # 1010  => 2
hamming_weight(21) # 10101 => 3
```
