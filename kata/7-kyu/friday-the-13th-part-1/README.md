[View on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5925acf31a9825d616000e74/python)

## Description

It's Friday the 13th, and Jason is ready for his first killing spree!

Create a function, `kill_count`, that accepts two arguments:
- An array of array pairs (the counselor's name and intelligence, e.g., `["Chad", 2]`)
- An integer representing Jason's intelligence

### Example (Ruby, Python, Crystal):

```python
counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
jason = 7
```

Your function must return an array of the names of all the counselors who can be outsmarted and killed by Jason.
