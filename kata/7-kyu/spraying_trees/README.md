[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5981a139f5471fd1b2000071/python)

## Description

There are five workers: **James**, **John**, **Robert**, **Michael** and **William**. They work in a fixed order from Monday to Friday, and they rest on weekends. The order of work is as follows:

- James works on **Monday**,
- John works on **Tuesday**,
- Robert works on **Wednesday**,
- Michael works on **Thursday**,
- William works on **Friday**.

Your task is to create a function that takes three arguments:

- **Weekday**: The day of the week (e.g., Monday).
- **Number of Trees**: The number of trees that must be sprayed on that day.
- **Cost per Litre**: The cost of 1 litre of liquid needed to spray a tree. Assume that 1 tree requires 1 litre of liquid.

The total cost of the liquid to spray all trees is denoted as `x`.

The function should return a string in the following format:

```
It is (weekday) today, (name), you have to work, you must spray (number) trees and you need (x) dollars to buy liquid
```

### Examples

**Input:**

- Weekday: `"Monday"`
- Number of Trees: `15`
- Cost per Litre: `2`

**Output:**

```
It is Monday today, James, you have to work, you must spray 15 trees and you need 30 dollars to buy liquid.
```
