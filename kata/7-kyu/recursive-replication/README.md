# Recursive Replication

You need to design a recursive function called `replicate` which will receive arguments `times` and `number`.

The function should return an array containing repetitions of the `number` argument. For instance:

```python
replicate(3, 5)  # returns [5, 5, 5]
```

If the `times` argument is negative, return an empty array.

As tempting as it may seem, **do not use loops** to solve this problem.
