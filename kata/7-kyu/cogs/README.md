## Kata Task
You are given a list of cogs in a gear train.

Each element represents the number of teeth of that cog.

For example:
```python
[100, 75]
```
- 1st cog has 100 teeth
- 2nd cog has 75 teeth

If the first cog rotates clockwise at 1 RPM, what is the RPM of the final cog?

> Use negative numbers for anti-clockwise rotation.

## Notes
- No two cogs share the same shaft
