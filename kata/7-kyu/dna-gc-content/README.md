The four bases found in DNA are adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine (`G`), and thymine (`T`).

In genetics, **GC-content** is the percentage of Guanine (`G`) and Cytosine (`C`) bases on a DNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine.

Given a DNA sequence (a string), return the GC-content in percent.

For more information about GC-content, you can take a look at [Wikipedia - GC-content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content).

## Example
The GC-content of the following DNA sequence is 50%:

```python
"AAATTTCCCGGG"  # 6 out of 12 bases are G or C
```
