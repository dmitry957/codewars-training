[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57ed40e3bd793e9c92000fcb/python)

Bob is a chicken sexer. His job is to sort baby chicks into Male (`M`) and Female (`F`) piles. When Bob can't guess, he can throw his hands up and declare it with a `?`.

Bob's bosses don't trust his ability just yet, so they have paired him with an expert sexer. All of Bob's decisions will be checked against the expert's choices to generate a correctness score.

## Scoring Rules
- When they agree, he gets **1 point**.
- When they disagree but one has said `?`, he gets **0.5 points**.
- When they disagree completely, he gets **0 points**.
