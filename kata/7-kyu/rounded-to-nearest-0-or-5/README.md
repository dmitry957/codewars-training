# Round to Nearest 0 or 5

[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582f52208278c6be55000067/python)

Given an array of numbers, return an array with each member of the input array rounded to the nearest number divisible by 5.

For example, given the following array:

```python
[34.5, 56.2, 11, 13]
```

should return:

```python
[35, 55, 10, 15]
```

Roundings have to be done like "in real life":

```python
22.5 -> 25
```
