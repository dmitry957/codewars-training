[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57b6f850a6fdc76523001162/python)

## Task

As a step towards achieving this; you have decided to create a function that will produce a multi-dimensional array out of the hit count value. Each inner dimension of the array represents an individual digit in the hit count, and will include all numbers that come before it, going back to 0.

### Rules

- The function will take one argument which will be a four character string representing hit count
- The function must return a multi-dimensional array containing four inner arrays
- The final value in each inner array must be the actual value to be displayed
- Values returned in the array must be of the type number

### Examples

```python
counterEffect("1250") // [[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3,4,5],[0]] 
counterEffect("0050") // [[0],[0],[0,1,2,3,4,5],[0]] 
counterEffect("0000") // [[0],[0],[0],[0]]
```
