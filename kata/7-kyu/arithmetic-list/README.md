# Arithmetic List

[View on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541da001259d9ca85d000688/python)

In this kata, you will write an **arithmetic list**, which is a list containing consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence.

## Parameters
You will be given three parameters:

- `first`: the first term in the sequence
- `c`: the constant that you are going to **add** (since it is an arithmetic sequence)
- `l`: the number of terms that should be returned
