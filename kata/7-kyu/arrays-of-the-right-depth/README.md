# Arrays of the Right Depth

## Description

You are given a main array (a list of lists) and a dictionary of depth constraints. Each subarray in the main array can either be empty ([]) or contain only one nested array—nothing else.

## Task

Your goal is to verify whether all arrays inside the main array adhere to the given depth constraints.

## Understanding Depth

The depth is zero-based:

The elements in the main array have depth 1.
A single nested empty array ([[]]) has depth 2.
A double-nested empty array ([[[]]]) has depth 3, and so on.
The depth constraints do not apply to the main array itself, only to the subarrays inside it.

## Constraints Dictionary

The dictionary keys represent valid depths.
The corresponding values indicate the maximum number of arrays at that depth that can appear in the main array.
If the dictionary is empty, then there are no valid depths (meaning the result should be False).
If an array has a depth not listed in the dictionary, return False.
If there are more arrays of a certain depth than allowed, return False.
If all constraints are met, return True.

## Examples

[[[]]], {2:1} -> True

Explanation: The only element in the main array ([ [[]] ]) is an array with a single empty array inside it. This means it has depth 2, which is allowed once ({2:1}).

[[[]], [[]]], {2:1} -> False

Explanation: There are two arrays with depth 2, but only 1 is allowed.

[ [[]], [], [[[]]], [], [[]] ], {2:6,1:2,3:1} -> True

Explanation:

Depth 1: There are two empty arrays ([]), and {1:2} allows them.
Depth 2: There are three [[]], and {2:6} allows up to 6.
Depth 3: There is one [[[]]], and {3:1} allows 1.
No other depths appear, and all constraints are satisfied.
[ [[]], [], [[[]]], [], [[]] ], {2:1,1:2,3:1}  -> False

[ [[]], [], [[[]]], [], [[]] ], {2:6,1:2} -> False

[ [[]], [], [[[]]], [], [[]] ], {} -> False

[ [[]], [] ], {2:6,1:2,3:1,10:8,5:1,6:4} -> True

[ [] ], {1:1} -> True

[ [] ], {} -> False
