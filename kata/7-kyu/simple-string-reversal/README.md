# Simple string reversal

[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a71939d373c2e634200008e/python)

## Description

In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.

For example:

```python
"our code" => "edo cruo"
# Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo".
# However, there is a space at index 3, so the string becomes "edo cruo"

"your code rocks" => "skco redo cruoy"
"codewars" => "srawedoc"
```
