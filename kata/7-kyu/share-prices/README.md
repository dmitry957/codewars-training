[View on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5603a4dd3d96ef798f000068/python)

You spent all your saved money to buy some shares.

You bought it for `invested`, and want to know how much it's worth, but all the info you can quickly get are just the changes the share price made in percentages.

## Task

Write the function `sharePrice()` that calculates and returns the current price of your share, given the following two arguments:

- `invested` (number): the amount of money you initially invested in the given share
- `changes` (array of numbers): contains your share's daily movement percentages

The returned number should be in string format, and its precision should be fixed at 2 decimal numbers.
