Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: [Wikipedia - DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)

In DNA strings, symbols `"A"` and `"T"` are complements of each other, as are `"C"` and `"G"`. Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
