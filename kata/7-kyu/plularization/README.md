# Pluralization

[View on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57fe7ea808d102a2ba000edd/python)

## Description

Your code should take an English noun with a regular plural form and return its plural.

## Rules for Pluralization

1.  If a singular noun ends in `-s`, `-x`, `-z`, `-ch`, or `-sh`, add `-es`.
2.  If a singular noun ends with a consonant and `-y`, change `-y` to `-ies`.
3.  All other words just add `-s`.

**Note:** None of the tests end in `-f` or `-o`, and none are irregular nouns (e.g., child, mouse, etc.).

## Examples

```
table -> tables
window -> windows
church -> churches
watch -> watches
bus -> buses
box -> boxes
buzz -> buzzes
fly -> flies
```
