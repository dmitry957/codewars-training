# How Much Coffee Do You Need?

[View on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57de78848a8b8df8f10005b1/python)

Everybody knows that you spent too much time awake during the night...

Your task here is to define how much coffee you need to stay awake after your night. You will have to complete a function that takes an array of events as arguments. According to this list, you will return the number of coffees you need to stay awake during the daytime.

**Note:** If the count exceeds 3, please return `'You need extra sleep'`.

## The list of events can contain the following:

- You come here to solve some kata (`'cw'`).
- You have a dog or a cat that just decided to wake up too early (`'dog'` | `'cat'`).
- You just watched a movie (`'movie'`).
- Other events can be present and will be represented by arbitrary strings; just ignore these.

Each event can be lowercase or uppercase. If it is lowercase, you need 1 coffee per event; if it is uppercase, you need 2 coffees.
