## Description

A grid is a perfect starting point for many games (Chess, battleships, Candy Crush!).

Making a digital chessboard I think is an interesting way of visualising how loops can work together.

Your task is to write a function that takes two integers `rows` and `columns` and returns a chessboard pattern as a two dimensional array.

## Rules

- The white spaces should be represented by an: `'O'`
- The black spaces should be represented by an: `'X'`
- The first row should always start with a white space `'O'`

## Examples

### Example 1: chessBoard(6,4)

```python
[
    ["O","X","O","X"],
    ["X","O","X","O"],
    ["O","X","O","X"],
    ["X","O","X","O"],
    ["O","X","O","X"],
    ["X","O","X","O"]
]
```

### Example 2: chessBoard(3,7)

```python
[
    ["O","X","O","X","O","X","O"],
    ["X","O","X","O","X","O","X"],
    ["O","X","O","X","O","X","O"]
]
```
