## Task

Complete the function to create backronyms. Transform the given string (without spaces) to a backronym, using the preloaded dictionary and return a string of words, separated with a single space (but no trailing spaces).

## Dictionary Structure

The keys of the preloaded dictionary are uppercase letters A-Z and the values are predetermined words, for example:

```python
dictionary["P"] == "perfect"
```

## Examples

```python
"dgm" ==> "disturbing gregarious mustache"
"lkj" ==> "literal klingon joke"
```
