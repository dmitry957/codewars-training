A lot of museums allow you to be a member. For a certain amount (`amount_by_year`), you can have unlimited access to the museum.

In this kata, you should complete a function in order to know after how many visits it will be better to take an annual pass. The function takes 2 arguments: `annual_price` and `individual_price`.
