# Well of Ideas - Harder Version

---

For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

In this kata you need to check the provided 2 dimensional array (`x`) for good ideas `'good'` and bad ideas `'bad'`.

- If there are one or two good ideas, return `'Publish!'`.
- If there are more than 2, return `'I smell a series!'`.
- If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return `'Fail!'`.

The sub-arrays may not be the same length.

The solution should be case insensitive (i.e., `good`, `GOOD`, and `gOOd` all count as a good idea). All inputs may not be strings.
