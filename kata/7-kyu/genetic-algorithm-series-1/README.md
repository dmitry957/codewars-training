# Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate

[Codewars Kata Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/567d609f1c16d7369c000008/python)

A genetic algorithm is based on groups of chromosomes, called populations. To start our population of chromosomes, we need to generate random binary strings with a specified length.

In this kata, you have to implement a function `generate` that receives a length and returns a random binary string with that many characters.

## Example

Generate a chromosome with length of 4:

```python
generate(4)  # could return '0010', '1110', '1111', ... or any of 2^4 possibilities
```
