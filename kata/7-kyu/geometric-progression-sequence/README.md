## Description

In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first n elements of the sequence with the given constant r and first element a.

Result should be separated by comma and space.

## Example

```
geometric_sequence_elements(2, 3, 5) == '2, 6, 18, 54, 162'
```
