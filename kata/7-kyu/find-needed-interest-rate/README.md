# Find Needed Interest Rate

## Description

You have an amount of money `initial` and want to grow it to amount `target` in `n` years. Calculate the annual interest rate needed if interest is compounded `period` times each year.

- `n` and `period` are positive integers.
- `initial` and `target` are real numbers, with `0 < initial â‰¤ target`. They are passed into the function as decimals, objects of type `Decimal`.
- The function should return a decimal representing the interest rate as a percentage.

`Decimal` is a Python class that provides exact representation of decimal values. Using the data-type `float` results in numerical inaccuracies because many numbers cannot be exactly represented in binary. For example, `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1` is typically `0.30000000000000004` rather than `0.3`. Using decimals avoids these errors; `Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.1')` is exactly equal to `Decimal('0.3')`. Using decimals does not eliminate all numerical error; for example, the fact that irrational numbers cannot be perfectly represented as fractions is an unavoidable source of numerical error. But decimals should be preferred to floats in domains, like finance, that require very accurate calculations.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Suppose `initial = 1000`, `target = 1210`, `n = 2` and `period = 1` (interest compounded annually). The function is called with `initial = Decimal('1000')`, `target = Decimal('1210')`. It should return `Decimal('10')`, because the needed interest rate is 10%.

- In year 1 you earn 10% * 1000 = 100. This is added to your investment at the end of the year, so you have 1100 at the beginning of year 2.
- In year 2 you earn 10% * 1100 = 110. This is added to the 1100 at the end of the year, yielding 1210 as desired.

**Example 2:**
To see the effect of the compounding period, change `period` to 2 (interest compounded every 6 months). This lowers the needed interest rate to approximately 9.762%.

- In the first 6 months you earn (9.762%/2) * 1000 = 48.81. This is added to the 1000.
- In the next 6 months you earn (9.762%/2) * 1048.81 = 51.19. This raises the amount to 1048.81 + 51.19 = 1100.
- You have the same amount at the end of year 1 as Example 1, because the lower interest rate is compounded more often. Year 2 grows 1100 to 1210 in a similar way.

The function should not round the result. If it is used in a wider context (e.g. to compare with another investment), we want maximum accuracy in the result. We can round the result whenever we want to display it. For example 2, the function should return `Decimal('9.761769634030309398290702800')` or something very close to it. Answers are accepted if within 0.00000000001 of the solution.

**Note:**
- The arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (exponentiation) return a decimal if both operands are decimals or one is a decimal and the other an integer. But they cannot be used if one operand is a decimal and the other is a float; the float should first be converted to a decimal.
