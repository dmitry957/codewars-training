## Task

Write a function that takes an integer as input and outputs a string with currency format.

An integer in currency format is expressed by a string of numbers where every three characters are separated by a comma.

---

## Example

```python
123456  # âžž "123,456"
```

Input will always be a positive integer, so don't worry about type checking or negative/float values.
