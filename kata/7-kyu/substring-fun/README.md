# Substring Fun

Complete the function that takes an array of words.

You must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where `n` is the position of the word in the list.

## Example

```python
["yoda", "best", "has"]  -->  "yes"
  ^        ^        ^
  n=0     n=1     n=2
```

**Note:** Test cases contain valid input only — i.e. a string array or an empty array; and each word will have enough letters.
