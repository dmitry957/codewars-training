For example, given a n=4 you must to print this pyramid:

```
   /\
  /  \
 /    \
/______\ 
```

Other example, given a n=6 you must to print this pyramid:

```
     /\

   /    \
  /      \

/__________\
```

Another example, given a n=10, you must to print this pyramid:

```
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
     /        \
    /          \
   /            \
  /              \
 /                \

Note: a line feed character is needed at the end of the string. Case n=0 should so return "\n".
