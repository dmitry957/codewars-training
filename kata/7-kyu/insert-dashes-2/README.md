# Insert Dashes 2

## Description
Write a function that takes a non-negative integer, insert dashes ('-') between each two odd digits and insert asterisks ('*') between each two nonzero even digits.

### For example:
```python
454793 --> "4547-9-3"
1012356895 --> "10123-56*89-5"
```
Note: Digit zero ('0') is not considered when inserting dashes or asterisks.
