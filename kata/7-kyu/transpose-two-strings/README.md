# Transpose two strings in an array

**URL:** https://www.codewars.com/kata/581f4ac139dc423f04000b99/python

## Description

You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.

### Example

```javascript
transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);
```

should return

```
H W  
e o  
l r  
l l  
o d
```

### Notes

A few things to note:

- There should be one space in between the two characters
- You don't have to modify the case (i.e. no need to change to upper or lower)
- If one string is longer than the other, there should be a space where the character would be
