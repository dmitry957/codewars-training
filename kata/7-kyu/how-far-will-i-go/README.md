You have recently discovered that horses travel in a unique pattern â€” they're either running (at top speed) or resting (standing still).

Here's an example of how one particular horse might travel:

> The horse Blaze can run at 14 metres/second for 60 seconds, but must then rest for 45 seconds.  
> After 500 seconds Blaze will have traveled 4200 metres.

Your job is to write a function that returns how far a horse will have traveled after a given time.

## Input
- `totalTime`: How long the horse will be traveling (in seconds)
- `runTime`: How long the horse can run for before having to rest (in seconds)
- `restTime`: How long the horse has to rest for after running (in seconds)
- `speed`: The max speed of the horse (in metres/second)
